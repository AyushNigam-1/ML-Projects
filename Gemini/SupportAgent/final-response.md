The agent stopped due to an iteration limit or time limit because the training process was not able to converge within the specified number of iterations or time. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:

- The learning rate is too high or too low.
- The model is too complex or the data is too noisy.
- The batch size is too large or too small.
- The training data is not representative of the real world data.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

- Reduce the learning rate.
- Simplify the model or clean the data.
- Adjust the batch size.
- Collect more training data.
